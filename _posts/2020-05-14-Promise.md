## 实现一个简易版Promise
```
const PENDING = 'pending'
const RESOLVED = 'resolved'
const REJECTED = 'rejected'

function Promise(fn) {
  const that = this
  this.state = PENDING
  this.value = null
  this.resolvedCallbacks = []
  this.rejectedCallbacks = []


  function resolve(value) {
    if(that.state === PENDING) {
      that.state = RESOLVED
      that.value = value
      that.resolvedCallbacks.map(cb => cb(that.value))
    }
  }
  function reject(value) {
    if(that.state === PENDING) {
      that.state = REJECTED
      that.value = value
      that.rejectedCallbacks.map(cb => cb(that.value))
    }
  }

  try {
    fn(resolve, reject)
  } catch (e) {
    reject(e)
  }
}

Promise.prototype.then = function(onFulfilled, onRejected){
  const that = this
  onFulfilled = typeof === 'function' ? onFulfilled : v => v
  onRejected = typeof === 'function'
   ? onRejected 
   : r => {
      throw r
     }
  if(that.state === PENDING) {
    that.resolvedCallbacks.push(onFulfilled)
    that.rejectedCallbacks.push(onRejected)
  }

  if(that.state === RESOLVED) {
    onFulfilled(that.value)
  }

  if(that.state === REJECTED) {
    onRejected(that.value)
  }
 }
```

## 实现一个符合Promise/A+规范的Promise
```
const PENDING = 'pending'
const RESOLVED = 'resolved'
const REJECTED = 'rejected'

function Promise(fn) {
  const that = this
  this.state = PENDING
  this.value = null
  this.resolvedCallbacks = []
  this.rejectedCallbacks = []


  function resolve(value) {
    if(value instanceof Promise) {
      return value.then(resolve, reject)
    }
    setTimeout(() => {
      if(that.state === PENDING) {
        that.state = RESOLVED
        that.value = value
        that.resolvedCallbacks.map(cb => cb(that.value))
      }
    }, 0)
  }
  function reject(value) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if(that.state === PENDING) {
        that.state = REJECTED
        that.value = value
        that.rejectedCallbacks.map(cb => cb(that.value))
      }
    }, 0)
  }

  try {
    fn(resolve, reject)
  } catch (e) {
    reject(e)
  }

  function resolutionProcedure(promise2, x, resolve, reject) {
    if(promise2 === x) {
      return reject(new TypeError('error'))
    }
    if( x instanceof Promise) {
      x.then(function(value) {
        resolutionProcedure(promise2, value, resolve, reject)
      }, reject)
    }
  }
}

Promise.prototype.then = function(onFulfilled, onRejected){
  const that = this
  if(that.state === PENDING) {
    return (promise2 = new Promise(resolve, reject) => {
      that.resolvedCallbacks.push(() => {
        try {
          const x = onFulfilled(that.value)
          resolutionProcedure(promise2, x, resolve, reject)
        } catch (r) {
          reject(r)
        }
      })
      that.rejectedCallbacks.push(() => {
        try {
          const x = onRejected(that.value)
          resolutionProcedure(promise2, x, resolve, reject)
        }
      })
    })
  }
  onFulfilled = typeof === 'function' ? onFulfilled : v => v
  onRejected = typeof === 'function'
   ? onRejected 
   : r => {
      throw r
     }

  if(that.state === RESOLVED) {
    onFulfilled(that.value)
    return(promise2 = new Promise(resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        try {
          const x = onFulfilled(that.value)
          resolutionProcedure(promise2, x, resolve, reject)
        } catch(reason) {
          reject(reason)
        }
      })
    })
  }

  if(that.state === REJECTED) {
    onRejected(that.value)
  }
 }
```
